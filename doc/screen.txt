Kernel get booted by GRUB in text mode. screen is a framebuffer that controls a
screen of characters 80 * 25. 

The framebuffer is accessible just like normal RAM, at address 0xB8000. Which
dedicated video memory that has been memory-mapped via hardware into our linear
address space.

Each character represented in 16-bits, the offset form link (y * 80 + x) * 2.

A charactor is ASCII encoded, 8 bits for representing a charactor, and rest for
designating foreground and background colors, format as below:
    15                       8            0

    red-4        magenta-5        brown-6        light_grey-7
    dary_grey-8  light_blue-9     light_green-10 light_cyan-11
    light_red-12 light_magneta-13 light_brown-14 white-15

VGA controller also has some ports on main I/O bus, from which you can send it
with specific instructions. It has a control register at 0x3D4 and a data
register at 0x3D5.
