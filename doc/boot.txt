<Multiboot>
A standard to GRUB expects a kernel to comply, it is the way for the
bootloader to
    1. Know exactly what environment the kernel wants/needs when boot
    2. Allow the kernel to query the environment it is in
    3. Info bootloader how kernel loaded

To make kernel multiboot compatible, should add a header structure in your
kernel (header located at first 4KB of the kernel).

<Calling Convention>
Use __cdecl calling convention
    1. All parameters to a function are on stack
    2. Parameters pushed right-to-left
    3. Return value in eax
